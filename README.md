# Overview

- MS Paint is overrated. So I made my own version.
- This was a three month project that taught me all about procedures, and keeping track of on-screen events. I was able to build a working paint application with all the actual features of MS paint, such as a free brush, circle, clear screen, square, eraser, text, and line tools. Along with 8 different paint choices to select from, both filled and non-filled choices.
